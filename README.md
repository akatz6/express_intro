# express_intro
To run this project start with:
  npm install
  node run dev

After you run npm instal this will create a node_modules file.
You do not want to add this file to your Github.
Create a new file called .gitignore and on the first line add /node_modules
This will tell Git to ignore your node_modules folder.
